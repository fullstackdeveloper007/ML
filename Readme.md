### Supervised Machine Learning
* Regression (Input to Output) Learn from being given ight Answer
* Classification Predict Categories
  
Supervised learning, refers to algorithms that learn x to y or input to output mappings. 
The key characteristic of supervised learning is that you give your learning algorithm examples to learn from. 
That includes the right answers, whereby right answer, I mean, the correct label y for a given input x, and is by seeing correct pairs
of input x and desired output label y that the learning algorithm eventually learns to take just the input alone without the output label 
and gives a reasonably accurate prediction or guess of the output. Let's look at some examples. If the input x is an email and the output 
y is this email, spam or not spam, this gives you your spam filter. Or if the input is an audio clip and the algorithm's job is output the text transcript, 
then this is speech recognition. Or if you want to input English and have it output to corresponding Spanish, Arabic, Hindi, Chinese, Japanese, 
or something else translation, then that's machine translation. Or the most lucrative form of supervised learning today is probably used in online advertising. 

Nearly all the large online ad platforms have a learning algorithm that inputs some information about an ad and some information about you and then tries 
to figure out if you will click on that ad or not. Because by showing you ads they're just slightly more likely to click on, for these large online ad platforms,
every click is revenue, this actually drives a lot of revenue for these companies. This is something I once done a lot of work on, maybe not the most inspiring application,
but it certainly has a significant economic impact in some countries today. Or if you want to build a self-driving car, the learning algorithm would take 
as input an image and some information from other sensors such as a radar or other things and then try to output the position of, say, 
other cars so that your self-driving car can safely drive around the other cars. Or take manufacturing. I've actually done a lot of work in this sector at learning AI.
You can have a learning algorithm takes as input a picture of a manufactured product, say a cell phone that just rolled off the production line and have the learning 
algorithm output whether or not there is a scratch, dent, or other defect in the product.
This is called visual inspection and it's helping manufacturers reduce or prevent defects in their products. 

* In all of these applications, you will first train your model with examples of inputs x and the right answers, that is the labels y. After the model has learned from these input, output, or x and y pairs,
